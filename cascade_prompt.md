# LushMeet Twitter Bot Generator Prompt

## Task Description
Create a complete Twitter bot for LushMeet, a private, invite-only matching platform connecting verified clients with high-end companions. The bot should promote LushMeet on Twitter through scheduled tweets, replies to trending niche tweets, and optional follow/DM functionality. The implementation must use a 100% free stack.

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x with Tweepy library for Twitter API v2 integration
- Flat file storage (.txt or .json) for tweet content and state management
- Deployment options for Replit, GitHub Actions (with cron jobs), or local execution
- Environment variables for secure credential storage
- Comprehensive error handling and rate limit management
- Logging system for tracking bot activities

## Bot Features

### 1. Scheduled Tweets
- Pull promotional content from a predefined list in `tweets.txt` or JSON array
- Post tweets at regular intervals (every 4-6 hours)
- Track posted tweets to avoid repetition
- Include luxury-themed hashtags and CTAs

### 2. Reply to Trending Tweets
- Search for tweets containing relevant hashtags: `#sugarbaby`, `#escortlife`, `#onlyfans`, `#luxury`, `GFE`
- Filter tweets based on engagement metrics (likes > 10, recent)
- Reply with subtle, on-brand CTAs that drive curiosity
- Implement rate limiting to avoid Twitter API restrictions

### 3. Optional: Strategic Follows and DMs
- Identify and follow active users in the target niche
- Send personalized, subtle DMs to potential high-value users
- Track sent DMs to avoid duplicate messages
- Implement proper timing delays between actions

## Required Files
1. `main.py`: Core bot logic and execution flow
2. `tweets.txt`: Collection of branded tweets for rotation
3. `replies.txt`: Template responses for trending tweet replies
4. `.env.example`: Template for environment variables (API keys)
5. `requirements.txt`: Dependencies (tweepy, python-dotenv, etc.)
6. `README.md`: Comprehensive setup, configuration, and deployment guide
7. Optional deployment files for Replit or GitHub Actions

## Brand Voice Guidelines
- Luxury-focused: Emphasize exclusivity, high-end experience
- Subtle yet assertive: Not overly promotional but confident
- Professional: No explicit content, focus on connections and quality
- Exclusive: Emphasize the invite-only, vetted nature of the platform
